# project BMP GoogleMaps
It is a tool for interpreting maps from Google Maps for the visually impaired, developed in C. The maps processed are from a search of hotels near a point of interest. The card interpretation tool will identify the various elements (hotels, points of interest and public transport), situate them in relation to each other and develop a voice message describing the situation.
